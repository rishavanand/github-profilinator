# Contribution Guidelines

## Branching System

We have two branches:

1. `master`: for production accessible via [http://profilinator.rishav.dev/](http://profilinator.rishav.dev/)
2. `dev`: for development and testing accessible via [https://dev-profilinator.rishav.dev/](https://dev-profilinator.rishav.dev/)

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Create an issue
2. Fork the repo and create your branch from `dev`.
3. Make changes to code or documentation
4. Commit changes
5. Squash commits solving a single issue
6. Rebase from upstream `dev` branch
7. Push commits
8. Create a new PR to `dev` branch
9. Link your PR to the issue

## Check builds locally before pushing

1. `npm run lint`
2. `npm run build`
